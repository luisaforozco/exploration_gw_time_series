# Ground water data investigation

This repo compiled different notebooks and files used to explore data access and methodologies to characterize time series of ground water levels.

## Requirements
The python environemnt is cluttered because of the different packages tested and used.
I'll try to update the exported env (`ts_wsl.yml`) that I am using and in which I am incrementally adding dependencies, so that it can be tested in other machines. To create an env based on such a config one can run:
```bash
conda env create -f ts_wsl.yml
```
